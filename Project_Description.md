## Overview
This project aims to revolutionize project management using autonomous AI agents to automate task allocation, progress tracking, predictive analytics, and natural language interactions. These agents enhance efficiency by distributing tasks based on team members' skills and availability, providing real-time updates on project status, and offering predictive insights to foresee potential delays or issues. Our solution integrates AI into the project management workflow, creating a more streamlined and proactive approach to managing teams and tasks.

## Key Features
- **Automated Task Allocation**: AI agents assign tasks based on team members' expertise and availability, ensuring optimal resource management.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Live updates on task progress, team performance, and project status.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning models analyze current project data to predict potential delays or bottlenecks and suggest strategic adjustments.
- **NLP Chatbot for Queries**: A chatbot powered by GPT models allows managers and team members to ask questions about the projectâ€™s status, tasks, and potential risks. The chatbot can answer both simple and complex queries in natural language.
  
  ### Sample Queries:
  - For **Managers**:
    - "What are the key tasks that need to be done soon?"
    - "Who is working on task X?"
    - "Which tasks are likely to miss their deadlines based on current progress?"
    - "Are there any duplicated tasks?"
  - For **Team Members**:
    - "Which task should I prioritize?"
    - "Considering the time needed for each task, can I meet all my deadlines?"

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Python**: Core programming language for building AI agents, backend logic, and chatbot functionality.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Used for predictive analytics, enabling the AI to forecast project outcomes and task delays.
- **OpenAI API**: Integrates GPT models to enable natural language processing for the chatbot, allowing users to ask questions and receive insights about the project.
- **Databases**: To store project data, tasks, and team information. Possible database solutions include:
  - **PostgreSQL**: For relational data storage.
  - **MongoDB**: For flexible and scalable document storage.
  
### Frontend
- **React.js**: Provides a dynamic and responsive UI for project managers and team members. The frontend will offer features like:
  - Task overview dashboard.
  - Real-time project updates and insights.
  - Predictive analytics visualization.
  - Chatbot Interface: A clean, interactive interface for asking questions to the NLP-based AI chatbot.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for fast and responsive styling.
  
### API Integration
- **RESTful APIs**: For communication between the frontend and backend. Ensures that project data, task updates, and predictive analytics are available in real-time.

## Project Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Set up the backend with Python, database integration, and initial AI agent functionality (task assignment and progress tracking).
2. **Phase 2**: Implement machine learning models for predictive analytics.
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate OpenAI API for GPT-based chatbot functionality and natural language interaction.
4. **Phase 4**: Build the frontend using React.js and integrate it with the backend for real-time task updates and chatbot interface.
5. **Phase 5**: Testing, optimization, and deployment.

## Conclusion
By leveraging AI, machine learning, and natural language processing, this project automates key aspects of project management, improving efficiency, predictability, and collaboration within teams. The autonomous AI agents and NLP chatbot will assist managers and team members alike, ensuring smoother project execution and better task management.
