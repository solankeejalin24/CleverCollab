# Task List
## Project: Autonomous AI Agents for Project Management Automation

#### **PHASE 1**
1. Investigate optimal machine learning models for predictive task analysis and forecasting delays.
Assigned to: **Jalin Solankee**

2. Research potential data preprocessing techniques for handling project/task data from the integrated project management boards (e.g., Trello, Jira).
Assigned to: **Varad Parte**

3. Design the chatbot interface for receiving and responding to user queries based on project data and predictive analytics.
Assigned to: **Daksh Prajapati**

4. Develop a data pipeline to integrate project/task data from project management boards into the AI agent system.
Assigned to: **Arya Narke**

#### **PHASE 2**
5. Implement the machine learning model for task prioritization based on deadlines, dependencies, and team members' availability.
Assigned to: **Arya Narke**

6. Test the task allocation module to ensure tasks are assigned based on skill matching and availability.
Assigned to: **Varad Parte**

7. Develop the OpenAI-based response generation module for natural language interaction with users.
Assigned to: **Daksh Prajapati**

8. Specify the data preprocessing techniques needed for predictive analysis to anticipate project delays.
Assigned to: **Jalin Solankee**

#### **PHASE 3**
9. Validate the trained AI model by running sample project data and ensuring accurate predictions of potential issues.
Assigned to: **Arya Narke**

10. Design a task allocation algorithm to match tasks with team members based on skill set and workload.
Assigned to: **Varad Parte**

11. Document the integration process of the chatbot interface with task prioritization and predictive analytics results.
Assigned to: **Daksh Prajapati**

12. Develop query parsing mechanisms for interpreting user prompts and directing queries to the appropriate modules (e.g., task allocation, predictive generation).
Assigned to: **Jalin Solankee**

#### **PHASE 4**
13. Test the overall system's ability to generate real-time project status updates and identify at-risk tasks.
Assigned to: **Arya Narke**

14. Refine the chatbot interface to improve user experience based on feedback from internal testing.
Assigned to: **Daksh Prajapati**

15. Implement context-matching logic for handling complex queries related to task dependencies and project status.
Assigned to: **Jalin Solankee**

16. Develop the predictive analysis module using historical project data to forecast potential delays and project risks.
Assigned to: **Varad Parte**

#### **PHASE 5**
17. Test the skill-based task allocation feature with sample user data to ensure proper matching and prioritization.
Assigned to: **Arya Narke**

18. Validate the system's accuracy in predicting project outcomes and flagging potential bottlenecks.
Assigned to: **Varad Parte**

19. Design the user interface for displaying task prioritization and progress tracking information to project managers and team members.
Assigned to: **Daksh Prajapati**

20. Document all API integrations, AI developments, etc. between the AI agent, project boards, and the OpenAI API.
