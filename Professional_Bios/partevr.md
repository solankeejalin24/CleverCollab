## Project Sought

 

I am seeking a capstone project that gives me the experience and learnings of producing a production ready software solution. Specifically, I am looking to implement a web application that requires full-stack development. I am also particularly interested in projects that involve any form of AI. Including AI in projects increases the efficiency and usability immensely. Projects of such nature will ensure I get exposure to the currently in-demand skills within the industry.
