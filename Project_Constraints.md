# Constraint Essay

In our project, several constraints impact the design and the possible solutions we can implement.

## Economic Constraints

### Budget and Resources
Since we are integrating technologies like machine learning models and GPT APIs, there are costs associated with API usage, cloud storage, and hosting. Our reliance on freeware or shareware might limit the scope of our project, especially when it comes to features like real-time updates or handling large datasets. If we are constrained by a limited budget, this could affect the quality and performance of the solution.

### Funding
We are working with self-funded resources, which limits our access to premium services such as high-tier APIs or cloud infrastructure. This might impact our system's ability to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Professional Constraints

### Specialized Expertise
Our project requires expertise in advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and natural language processing. While developing the project, we are gaining valuable knowledge and experience in these areas, which contributes to our professional growth. However, gaps in our expertise might slow down progress or present challenges in implementing certain features.

## Ethical Constraints

### Bias in AI Models
Since we are using AI and machine learning models, it is important for us to ensure that our algorithms do not introduce bias into task allocation or project predictions. If our models assign tasks unfairly, it could lead to an unbalanced workload or unequal task distribution among team members, which raises ethical concerns.

### Transparency and Fairness
We need to ensure that our AI agents are transparent in their decision-making processes. Users should clearly understand how tasks are assigned and on what basis. If the decision-making process is opaque, it could lead to mistrust in the system, which could affect user adoption.

## Security Constraints

### Data Privacy
Our project involves handling sensitive project management data, which means we must prioritize data security and privacy. We are responsible for ensuring that all user data is securely stored and protected from unauthorized access. Additionally, we need to ensure that any external APIs or services we use comply with security standards to avoid exposing sensitive information.
